/**
 * The `revenue_backfill` executor (ADR-0033, D2e/D4).
 *
 * On connect, walk ninety days of the customer's provider history — charges,
 * then refunds, then disputes — through the same ledger and the same object head
 * every webhook uses, so the dashboard has substance from the first minute
 * rather than from the first future sale.
 *
 * ## The subject is a credential, not a site
 *
 * The runner's `(type, subject_id)` liveness index therefore means **one live
 * backfill per credential**, which is the right grain in both directions: a site
 * that connects a second provider gets a second walk, and a
 * disconnect-and-reconnect gets a fresh one under a new credential id (a new
 * connection whose history has not been walked) rather than adopting the
 * previous connection's cursors.
 *
 * ## Resume, not restart
 *
 * `revenue_sync_state` is written after **every page** — cursor, window, and
 * whether the resource finished. This executor walks a bounded number of pages
 * and then returns a retry, so a ninety-day backfill of a busy account is a
 * sequence of short claims rather than one claim that outlives its lease. A
 * worker killed mid-walk changes nothing: the next claim reads the cursor and
 * continues from the page boundary it last recorded.
 *
 * That is also why the page budget exists at all. Walking until the provider
 * says `has_more: false` would make the job's runtime a function of a customer's
 * transaction volume, and the first thing to break would be the lease.
 *
 * ## Failure, and which kind it is
 *
 * The split is the one every executor in this directory draws:
 *
 * - **`unauthorized`** — the customer revoked or narrowed their key. Terminal,
 *   and it flips the credential to `degraded` with a categorized `last_error`.
 *   Retrying is pointless (the answer will not change) and harmful (a hundred
 *   attempts against a rejecting provider looks like an attack from their side).
 *   `last_synced_at` is deliberately **not** touched — a degraded credential
 *   must keep reporting when its data was last actually correct.
 * - **`unavailable`** — the provider or the network. Thrown, so the runner's own
 *   exponential backoff handles it and the credential's status is untouched: an
 *   outage that lasts an hour must not read as a bad credential for a week.
 * - **A missing keyring or adapter** — infrastructure this deployment does not
 *   have. A **counting** retry, for the export job's reason: nothing about it
 *   resolves on its own, and a non-counting retry would be an immortal job
 *   holding the credential's only backfill slot forever.
