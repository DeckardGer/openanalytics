/**
 * The provider-list walk shared by the backfill job and the reconcile sweep
 * (ADR-0033, D4).
 *
 * One implementation, two callers, and that is the point rather than a
 * convenience: the ADR's promise is that *both paths land in the same ledger and
 * the same object head, so overlap is free*. Two implementations would make that
 * a claim rather than a property — the moment one of them normalized a snapshot
 * time differently, a reconcile sweep would start overwriting webhook state.
 *
 * ## Where the idempotency actually lives
 *
 * On the **webhook** path the ledger is a short-circuit: the same `evt_…`
 * redelivered is the same delivery, so a row already `processed` ends the work.
 *
 * On the **sync** path it is not, and treating it as one would be a bug. A list
 * row has no delivery identity — it is recorded under a deterministic synthetic
 * id (`backfill:{resource}:{object_id}`) precisely so re-listing an object
 * produces *one* ledger row instead of one per sweep — but the object's *state*
 * legitimately changes between sweeps. Short-circuiting on the row's status
 * would mean a charge refunded on Tuesday never updated, because Monday's sweep
 * had already marked its receipt `processed`.
 *
 * So the sync path always runs the observation through the object head, and the
 * **object head is what dedupes**: an unchanged object produces an identical
 * payload hash at an identical snapshot time and the three-way rule skips it
 * without a write. The ledger row is a per-object receipt, bounded in count by
 * the deterministic id, and it records the last decision worth recording.
 *
 * ## Why a list row can force-apply its own tie
 *
 * The three-way rule answers `refetch_from_provider` when an incoming snapshot
 * ties an existing one on time but differs in payload — "ask the provider what
 * is true now", because neither payload can be ordered against the other.
 *
 * On this path that request has **already happened**: the observation came out
 * of a `GET` against the provider moments ago, so it *is* the authoritative
 * answer the tie-break would go and fetch. Issuing a second request for the same
 * object would return the same bytes, cost a rate-limit unit per tied object,
 * and on a large account would spend the whole budget re-reading things it had
 * just read. So the tie resolves in place with a forced apply — and `force`
 * still refuses a strictly older snapshot, so this cannot revert anything.
 *
 * The tie is not hypothetical: a webhook head stores the *event's* `created`
 * while a list row stores the *object's*, and for a charge whose first event
 * fired at creation the two are equal — with a different payload the moment that
 * charge is later refunded.
 *
 * ## The inherent limit of a `created`-filtered sweep (recorded, not fixable here)
 *
 * Stripe's list endpoints filter on the object's **`created`**, not on when it
 * last changed. So the reconcile sweep's trailing window catches every object
 * *created* inside it — and cannot see a late change to an object created before
 * it. A `charge.updated` dropped for a charge created three days ago is not
 * repaired by any sweep short of re-walking all of history.
 *
 * What that costs is bounded, and it is worth being precise about which part of
 * the number is at risk. **Money stays correct**, because a refund and a dispute
 * are their own objects with their own `created` — they land in their own
 * buckets by D2d, inside the window, whatever happened to the parent charge's
 * update. What can go stale is the parent charge's *status* string
 * (`refunded` / `partially_refunded`) if its update event was lost. Such a
 * charge still carries its full gross and the refund row still carries the
 * reduction, so totals and time series are unaffected; a transaction list could
 * show a status one revision old. Closing it properly means listing `events`
 * over the window — which the restricted key already permits — and is recorded
 * as a follow-up rather than guessed at here.
