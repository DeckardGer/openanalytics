/**
 * The revenue reconcile sweep (ADR-0033, D4).
 *
 * The webhook safety net. Webhooks are the fast path and they are not
 * guaranteed: a delivery can be dropped, answered 5xx until the provider gives
 * up, or lost while our endpoint was down. This loop re-lists a trailing window
 * for every credential whose data has gone stale, so a missed event is caught by
 * the next sweep rather than never.
 *
 * The overlap is **free**, which is the whole reason the design is allowed to be
 * this simple: both paths land in the same ledger and the same object head, so
 * re-listing an object we already hold produces an identical payload hash at an
 * identical snapshot time and the three-way rule skips it without a write.
 *
 * ## The freshness rules, which are the point of the whole loop
 *
 * 1. **`last_synced_at` moves only on a walk that reached the end of every
 *    resource.** Not on a failure, and — the subtler half — not on a *partial*
 *    success either. The page budget bounds a tick, so a large account is
 *    routinely `ok` with `completed: false`; stamping freshness there would
 *    report a credential as current while objects beyond the budget had never
 *    been read.
 * 2. **A failure never touches it at all.** A degraded credential keeps
 *    reporting when its data was last actually correct — plan 04's third
 *    acceptance criterion, and the behaviour snapshot 01 §12.3 records legacy
 *    getting wrong.
 * 3. **Nothing is ever zeroed.** An outage produces a status and a categorized
 *    `last_error`, never an empty result.
 *
 * ## The window is quantized, and that is what makes deep objects reachable
 *
 * `syncRevenueResource` resumes a stored cursor only when the window it was
 * taken in is *identical* — a provider cursor is a position inside a filtered
 * sequence. A window ending at `Date.now()` therefore changes on every tick, the
 * cursor is discarded every time, and the sweep re-reads the newest page
 * forever: an account with more objects in the window than one tick's budget
 * would have its older objects **never** re-listed.
 *
 * So the window end is floored to the staleness interval. Every tick inside one
 * interval computes the same bounds, the cursor survives, and successive ticks
 * walk deeper until the window completes — at which point `last_synced_at`
 * moves, the credential drops out of discovery, and the next interval opens a
 * fresh window.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot fight a running backfill
 *
 * **Writes are serialized by the object head.** Every observation from either
 * path goes through one `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on `(site, provider, object_id)`
 * and is decided against what is actually stored at that moment. A backfill page
 * and a sweep page touching the same charge queue on that lock, and the loser
 * re-decides against the winner's write rather than against a stale read. The
 * worst case is a redundant version bump, which is harmless by construction:
 * versions are monotonic and CP3's `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` keeps the
 * highest.
 *
 * **Cursors cannot collide either.** Discovery excludes a never-synced
 * credential while a backfill job is live for it, which is exactly the window in
 * which the two would otherwise share `revenue_sync_state` rows; after the
 * backfill completes it sets `last_synced_at`, and the staleness rule keeps them
 * apart from then on.
