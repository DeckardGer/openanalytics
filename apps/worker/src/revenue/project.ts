/**
 * The revenue projection loop (ADR-0033, D5). Milestone 12 Checkpoint 3.
 *
 * Drains changed object heads out of Postgres into `analytics.revenue_events`,
 * materializing the site's reporting currency and the two identity hashes on the
 * way. It is the only writer of that table, and it lives in the **worker**
 * because the api holds no ClickHouse credential at all (D-208) and must keep
 * holding none.
 *
 * ## Why it is a projection rather than a second ingest
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything about money. The head already holds the
 * canonical snapshot and the monotonic version Postgres minted under a row lock
 * (D4); this loop reads it, converts, hashes, and writes. That separation is
 * what makes every downstream change a *recompute*: a reporting-currency change,
 * a widened identity resolution, a corrected exponent table — each is a
 * re-projection over stored heads, never a re-ingest from the provider, which is
 * exactly the split D6 was built to preserve.
 *
 * ## Exactly-once, without a clock
 *
 * A head is due when `projected_version < version`, a predicate with no
 * timestamp in it (the migration argues this at length against the two
 * timestamp-watermark designs that were rejected). The tick then does, strictly
 * in this order:
 *
 *   1. read the due heads,
 *   2. build rows — pure over `(head, reporting currency, rates, hint)`,
 *   3. insert into ClickHouse under a content-derived deduplication token,
 *   4. mark the heads at the **literal** versions that were projected.
 *
 * A crash anywhere between 3 and 4 re-projects heads whose rows are already
 * there. Because step 2 is a pure function of `(head, reporting currency, rate
 * plan, hint)` — **with no clock in it**, which is why `ingested_at` is
 * `head.updatedAt` rather than the tick's time — the rebuilt rows are
 * byte-identical, so the token is identical, so ClickHouse drops them. The
 * re-projection costs a request and changes nothing. The reverse order would
 * mark heads whose rows were never written, and a marker (unlike a watermark)
 * never comes back.
 *
 * The one input to step 2 that can legitimately move between attempts is the
 * rate table: an ECB refresh between a failed insert and its retry produces
 * different reporting amounts, a different token, and a second row at the same
 * version. Two rows at one version is the hazard `argMax` cannot resolve —
 * it evaluates **per column**, so a mixed read is possible — and it is bounded
 * to the retry window of a single batch against a table that refreshes every few
 * hours. Recorded rather than solved: the general fix is the same version bump
 * `resetRevenueProjection` needs, and it is CP5's wiring.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do
 *
 * - **It never converts with a stale rate.** A currency the ECB does not list,
 *   or one whose newest rate predates the transaction by more than the lookback
 *   window, produces `conversion_source = 'unavailable'` with zeroed reporting
 *   amounts and the original currency and amount fully intact. CP5's read layer
 *   MUST surface those rows as an explicit unconverted remainder; folding the
 *   zeros into a reporting total is the confident-zero failure this milestone is
 *   named after.
 * - **It never writes an identifier.** Only the two site-scoped HMACs, under two
 *   different purpose tags. Nothing in this file logs a customer id, a client
 *   reference or a hash.
 * - **It never crashes the worker.** A ClickHouse outage is a counted failure
 *   and a return; this loop shares a process with batch ingest and email
 *   delivery.
