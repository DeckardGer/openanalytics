/**
 * The attribution job (ADR-0033, D6; ClickHouse migration 0017, Postgres 0036).
 * Milestone 12 Checkpoint 4.
 *
 * The session finalizer's idiom, applied to a different fact: per-site
 * discovery, a Postgres lease and watermark, a **pure** planner
 * (`planRevenueAttributions` in `@openanalytics/domain`), fingerprint-compared
 * versioned writes. Nothing here decides what an attribution says; it fetches
 * the planner's inputs, hashes the two identity signals the planner is not
 * allowed to hold a secret for, and makes the answer durable.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE HORIZON RULE — state it once, here, and test it
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * An attribution is a function of data that arrives AFTER the charge it
 * describes. Three inputs can move under a finished answer:
 *
 *   * a `conversion` event, up to 24 h late (D-016);
 *   * the session that is its touchpoint, which is not final until inactivity
 *     (30 min) plus that same lateness has passed;
 *   * a checkout hint, whose `checkout.session.completed` delivery can be
 *     retried by the provider long after the charge landed.
 *
 * A watermark that meant "everything before here is finished" would therefore be
 * a lie. So `computed_through` means "the instant whose inputs this site has
 * been computed against", and **every run re-reads a rolling window of charges
 * rather than only new ones**:
 *
 *     horizon = attribution window (30 d) + lateness (24 h)
 *     from    = min( now - horizon,          -- the rolling re-read
 *                    computed_through,       -- epoch on a fresh site
 *                    oldest charge head changed since computed_through )
 *     to      = now + 1 ms                   -- half-open, so a charge stamped
 *                                            -- exactly now is included
 *
 * Each of the three terms is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. `now - horizon` is what makes a late conversion event flip a charge from
 *      `none` to `exact`. Without it a charge attributed once would keep its
 *      first answer forever.
 *   2. `computed_through` is the epoch on a site that has never run, which is
 *      what makes the first pass cover a 90-day backfill (D2e) even though the
 *      rolling window is 31 days.
 *   3. The oldest *changed* head is the escape hatch for a backfill that lands
 *      AFTER the watermark has already moved — connect, one attribution pass,
 *      then the backfill completes. Without this term every charge older than
 *      the rolling window would sit unattributed forever, because nothing would
 *      ever pull the horizon back to it.
 *
 * Advancing to `now` (rather than to `now - lateness`) is deliberate and is safe
 * precisely because the horizon is rolling: the watermark is not a completeness
 * claim, so nothing depends on it being conservative. What it does buy is a
 * discovery predicate that goes quiet — a site with no new heads and no new
 * hints is re-run only when the refresh interval elapses.
 *
 * **What this rule permanently misses, named rather than left to be discovered:**
 * a charge older than `window + lateness` whose touchpoint session finalizes
 * late and whose object head never moves again. Term 1 no longer reaches it,
 * term 2 is long past, and term 3 needs the head to change. Its attribution
 * keeps whatever answer the last pass that could see it produced.
 *
 * It is unreachable outside a deep backfill, and that case is exactly what term 3
 * covers: a charge more than 31 days old is either historical (its sessions were
 * finalized weeks ago — the finalizer's own watermark can only lag ~48.5 hours)
 * or it arrived through a backfill, which moves the head and pulls the horizon
 * back to it. The gap needs a charge that is simultaneously old, already
 * projected, and still waiting on a session finalization that is a month
 * overdue — which the finalizer's bound makes impossible. Accepted, and the
 * alternative (never letting the floor advance) would mean re-reading a site's
 * entire revenue history 96 times a day forever.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE SITE'S OWN SWITCH — attribution is opt-in, the money is not
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A site with `attributed_revenue` off is rolled up and never attributed. The
 * check is one line in `attributeSite`, deliberately above every
 * attribution-only read and below the rollup closure, and the reasoning is with
 * it. In one sentence: the switch means "is this visitor linked to this
 * payment", so it has to be enforced where the linking happens, and two of D6's
 * three signals never pass through the collector where the browser half of the
 * rule lives.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Failure isolation and shutdown
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Per-site failure is caught INSIDE the site loop (the CP3 lesson: discovery is
 * `ORDER BY site_id LIMIT n`, so an uncaught throw on one site starves every
 * site sorting after it, permanently and silently). The failing site releases
 * its lease without advancing, so the next pass retries the identical horizon —
 * safe because the whole computation is a pure function of stored inputs.
 *
 * The stop flag is threaded INTO the tick rather than only guarding its start
 * (the CP2 lesson), so a shutdown cuts BETWEEN sites. Cutting there loses
 * nothing: each site's watermark is durable before the next site is claimed.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Secrets and logs
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `ANONYMOUS_IDENTITY_SECRET` is held read-only (D6 amendment) for one purpose:
 * hashing a checkout hint's `client_reference_id` into the `identify()`
 * derivation so it joins `session_facts_versions.user_id` byte for byte. No
 * hash, no visitor id, no order id and no customer identifier is ever logged —
 * the log lines carry counts, the site id and the `matched_via` histogram.

    //
    // Looked up PER PROVIDER, for the reason the projection loop gives:
    // `revenue_match_hints` is keyed by it, and two providers could in principle
    // mint the same PaymentIntent-shaped id, so a cross-provider join would
    // attribute one provider's checkout to another's charge. In practice a site

/**
 * A current fact plus its hint becomes the planner's charge input.
 *
 * **The two identity hashes are the interesting part.**
 *
 * `clientReferenceUserHash` (D6 signal 2) is the fact's `external_user_hash`
 * whenever the fact has one, because CP3's `resolveRevenueExternalUserId`
 * resolves that column from a client reference and from nothing else — so the
 * value on the fact IS the client-reference derivation. When the fact has none
 * but a hint does, the hash is computed HERE: that is the case where
 * `checkout.session.completed` arrived after the head was projected, and it is
 * exactly why the worker holds `ANONYMOUS_IDENTITY_SECRET` at all. The
 * derivation is `externalUserIdHash`, byte for byte the one the collector
 * applies to `identify()`, or the join against `user_id` would match nothing
 * while looking entirely reasonable.
 *
 * `customerIdentityUserHash` (D6 signal 3) is **always empty in CP4**, and that
 * is recorded rather than papered over. D5 words the signal as
 * `metadata.oa_external_id`, else the customer email. Neither is reachable from
 * anything at rest: `oa_external_id` lives on the Stripe *Customer*, which the
 * sync walk never lists, and an email is never stored in any form (D-102 forbids
 * the raw value and the api, which receives the payload, does not hold the
 * secret that would produce a hashed one). The field is threaded through the
 * planner anyway so the checkpoint that fetches a Customer in flight supplies it
 * without a caller, a signature or a test changing shape — the same discipline
 * `resolveRevenueExternalUserId` used one checkpoint earlier.
