/**
 * Where the request's network identity is read, and the only place a raw IP
 * exists (docs snapshot 02 §7.1 item 8; 05 D-102).
 *
 * The raw address is taken from the platform's headers, used to derive a geo
 * hint and a rate-limit bucket, and then discarded. It is never returned from
 * this module, never logged and never put on an event: `deriveVisitorContext`
 * takes it as an argument and gives back a structure with no field that could
 * hold one (ADR-0008), and `ClientIdentity` below has the same property.
 *
 * The IP is trusted only from headers the fronting proxy controls, never from
 * a client-settable one alone. `x-forwarded-for` is appended to by every hop,
 * so its *last* entry is the one the proxy observed; reading the first entry
 * would let a caller spoof their own rate-limit bucket by prepending an address.
 *
 * Since ADR-0015 the collector sits behind a reverse proxy of the deployment's
 * own, which asserts `X-Real-IP` from the connection and STRIPS every other
 * header in this list — on a platform nobody controls for us, a client could
 * simply send `fly-client-ip` and pick its own identity bucket. The list stays
 * so a future move back behind Vercel/Fly/Cloudflare is an env change, not a
 * code change; it is safe only while the fronting proxy removes what it does
 * not itself set.
