/**
 * The checks every ingest request passes before anything is written, in the
 * order docs snapshot 02 §7.1 puts them.
 *
 * Both routes share this because both must answer the same way to the same
 * situation: a revoked key, a blocked site, a foreign origin and a bot are not
 * different questions for a pageview and a heartbeat. The parts that differ —
 * the queue for one, the realtime write for the other — start after this.
 *
 * Order is not incidental:
 *
 * - The key resolves first, because nothing else is knowable without a site.
 * - Admission next (D-012/D-013/D-210), so a blocked or deleting site is refused
 *   before its counters are touched.
 * - Then the origin allowlist, which is cheap and site-scoped.
 * - Then the rate limits — charged for *all* traffic including bots, because an
 *   abuse ceiling that exempted anything claiming to be a crawler would be an
 *   abuse ceiling anyone could opt out of by editing a header.
 * - Bot classification last, so a filtered request has already paid its share of
 *   the site's budget and cannot be used to flood one for free.
