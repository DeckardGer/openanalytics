/**
 * The real tracking-key → ingest-config lookup, with the short-TTL versioned
 * cache docs snapshot 02 §7.2 permits.
 *
 * ADR-0008 left this a port because resolving a tracking key is Milestone 5's
 * work. This is that work: one Postgres read behind a cache that exists for one
 * reason — the collector runs on Vercel and reaches Postgres over the public
 * internet, so a per-event round trip would dominate the latency of accepting an
 * event.
 *
 * The cache is bounded in three directions, and the third is the one the design
 * actually rests on:
 *
 * 1. **Time.** `INGEST_CONFIG_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` — short, because a key revoked
 *    in the dashboard has to stop working promptly.
 * 2. **Size.** An LRU, so a key-probing flood cannot grow the cache without
 *    bound in a process that may live for hours.
 * 3. **Expiry.** A cached entry carries the key's own `keyExpiresAt`, and
 *    `decideIngestAdmission` refuses on it. §7.2 allows a short-TTL cache while
 *    Postgres is unavailable but is explicit that an expired or revoked key must
 *    never fail open into one, so the cache may serve a stale *config* and must
 *    never serve a dead *key*.
 *
 * A negative result is cached too, and deliberately for a shorter time: without
 * it, a flood of invalid keys becomes a flood of Postgres queries, which is the
 * cheapest possible denial of service against the collector.
