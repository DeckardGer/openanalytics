   * Delete a site (ADR-0030, decision 4).

   * The most destructive endpoint in the product, and every guard in front of it

   *
   * - `siteMembership` — is the caller party to this site at all;
   * - `requireCapability('site:delete')` — the capability has existed since M2,
   *     is owner-only and has never had a caller until now;
   * - `isRecentReauth` — was the *session* recently proven, not merely valid.
   *     Deletion sits beside the billing cutover in that respect: a stolen laptop
   *     with a live cookie must not be able to erase a customer's history;
   * - the name confirmation — the human typed the site's own name. It is checked
   *     against the site's *current* name read in this request, never against a
   *     value the client sent alongside it, which would make the confirmation
   *     self-referential;
   * - `idempotent` — a retried request replays instead of starting a second
   *     deletion. The repository is idempotent as well (it returns the live
   *     request for a site already `deleting`), so the two agree rather than one
   *     covering for the other.
   *
   * The answer is `202`, not `200`: deletion is a state machine that runs for as
   * long as ClickHouse takes to rewrite its parts. The client polls
   * `GET /v1/sites/{id}` and reads `status`, which stays `deleting` until the
   * tombstone lands and the site disappears from the list entirely.

   * this route's second non-bumping field for the same reason as the first. It
   * is an *override* on ADR-0026's user preference, never a replacement:
   * `users.timezone` is still what the dashboard sends on every analytics
   * request, and setting this changes no private query. What it does is give the
