/**
 * The business subtree, opened to OAuth grants under a default-deny allowlist
 * (ADR-0048 D2).
 *
 * Everything on `/v1/*` behind this middleware has always required a browser
 * session. An MCP client holds a bearer, not a cookie, and the four read
 * scopes reach only `/v1/read/*` and `/mcp` — never a mutation. This is the
 * seam that lets a narrow, enumerated set of writes ride the *real* business
 * routes: no parallel `/v1/write/*` API, no duplicated membership or billing
 * gate, one place the rules live.
 *
 * The shape of the safety is a table, not a flag. A grant-authenticated
 * request proceeds only when `(method, path)` matches a row in
 * `GRANT_WRITE_ALLOWLIST` **and** the grant carries that row's scope;
 * everything else on the subtree answers `403` to a bearer. Site deletion,
 * member and invite management, API keys, billing movement, imports/exports,
 * event and widget *deletion* — none has a row, so none is reachable however
 * the grant's scope string reads. The Vercel/Stripe/Supabase line (no
 * deletion, no members, no money) is this table.
 *
 * A matched request is then indistinguishable from a session request to every
 * downstream handler: `siteMembership` re-reads live membership,
 * `requireCapability` refuses a viewer exactly as it does in a browser, and the
 * billing/lifecycle gates run untouched. The scope is a ceiling, the role is
 * the authority, and they are intersected — a viewer with a write-scoped token
 * writes nothing (ADR-0042 D3, ADR-0043 D4).
