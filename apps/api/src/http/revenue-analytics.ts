/**
 * The revenue read surface (ADR-0033, D7). Milestone 12 Checkpoint 5.
 *
 * Four endpoints — summary, timeseries, transactions, journey — and one
 * authorization stack on all of them:
 *
 * ```
 * sessionAuth → siteMembership → requireAnalyticsAccess → requireCapability('revenue:read')
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate mount from `analytics.ts`
 *
 * The analytics surface is **membership-gated and capability-free**: 02 §19 gives
 * a viewer analytics read, so `createAnalyticsRoutes` deliberately has no
 * `requireCapability` in front of it. Revenue is the opposite — `revenue:read`
 * has sat in the owner-only set of `packages/domain/src/authz.ts` beside
 * `export:raw` and `site:delete` since M2 with **no route ever requiring it**,
 * and D7 confirms owner-only as the launch posture. Adding a capability gate to
 * a subtree that has none would be one `app.use` away from gating the whole
 * dashboard for admins, so the two live apart.
 *
 * `requireAnalyticsAccess` is still in the stack, and not merely for the
 * `config_version` it sets: 02 §23 closes revenue read with `suspended`
 * exactly as it closes every other analytics read, and the 402 comes from there.
 * Note the contrast with the **connection** routes in `revenue.ts`, which are
 * deliberately NOT behind it — reading the money is what billing gates; severing
 * a provider link is not.
 *
 * ## The connection block is read here, once, per request
 *
 * The service holds a query gateway and nothing else, so the credential row is
 * read at this layer and threaded in. It is what makes an empty response
 * interpretable (D7's `not_connected` / no-sales / `degraded` trichotomy), and
 * it is the newest row of **any** status — a site that connected and then
 * disconnected reads `disconnected`, never `not_connected`, because those are
 * different sentences on the empty-state screen and CP1 kept the row precisely
 * so the API could tell them apart.
