/**
 * The reporting-currency vocabulary, and how to print money in it.
 *
 * **This list is a copy, and the original is server-side** —
 * `packages/domain/src/reporting-currency.ts`, which `apps/web` may not import
 * (D-218: the frontend depends on `@openanalytics/contracts` and nothing
 * else). The contract types it as a bare `string`, so the closed set does not
 * reach us as a union either.
 *
 * Copying it is what the contract asks for: *"Build the picker from a fixed
 * list in the UI and this error never fires"* (frontend_api_contract, Reporting
 * currency). The alternative — a free-text field — is the failure the server
 * list exists to prevent: `ZZZ` passes the `^[A-Z]{3}$` check and a site set to
 * it converts nothing, producing an entirely empty revenue dashboard from a
 * typo with no error anywhere to explain it.
 *
 * The drift risk is real and bounded: a code added server-side is simply
 * missing from our picker until it is added here, and a code removed
 * server-side becomes a `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` naming `reporting_currency`.
 * Neither corrupts anything. Adding one is a one-line change in both places.
