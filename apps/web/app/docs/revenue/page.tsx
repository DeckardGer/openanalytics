        <p>
          Under your site&apos;s Settings, Integrations, connect Stripe with
          a restricted, read-only key: a couple of minutes, no code changes.
          From then on payments, refunds, disputes and fees flow into the
          Revenue tab, joined to the visits that produced them where a
          signal exists. Disconnecting stops the flow immediately.
        </p>
      </DocSection>

      <DocSection title="Attribution is opt-in, and it asks something of you">
        <p>
          Revenue totals need nothing from your visitors. Tying a payment back
          to the visit that produced it is different on both counts: you turn{" "}
          <strong>Attributed revenue</strong> on when connecting Stripe — until
          you do, the script sends no <Code>order_id</Code> at all and the
          conversion is just a count — and the linking itself carries a consent
          obligation you meet as the controller of your site. The switch is
          enforced on both sides: an <Code>order_id</Code> that arrives while it
          is off, from a cached copy of the script or a request you wrote
          yourself, is dropped from the event before it is stored. The
          conversion is still counted.
        </p>
        <DocCode caption="wherever you record the visitor's choice">{`oa.consent("granted"); // or "denied", which stops collection entirely`}</DocCode>
        <p>
          We do not hold the hint back on a consent state we cannot see, so
          wiring this is yours to do. The best place to ask is your own checkout
          page: consent collected inside Stripe Checkout is consent for taking
          payment, and the analytics link is a different purpose with a
          different controller — you.

              <Code>order_id</Code> is the Stripe Checkout Session (
              <Code>cs_…</Code>), PaymentIntent (<Code>pi_…</Code>) or
              charge id (<Code>ch_…</Code>), whichever your page has.

      <DocSection title="Recipe 2: identify plus client_reference_id">
        <p>
          When your success page cannot know the order, pass the same stable
          user reference to both sides:
        </p>
        <DocCode caption="browser">{`oa.identify("user_8f21c4");`}</DocCode>
        <DocCode caption="server, creating the checkout">{`stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  client_reference_id: "user_8f21c4",
  // ...
});`}</DocCode>
        <p>
          Both sides are hashed with the same site-scoped derivation and
          joined without either value ever being stored raw. This yields
          confidence &quot;linked&quot;: it identifies the person rather
          than the order, which is exactly what makes it the fallback. See{" "}
          <DocLink slug="identify">identify</DocLink> for the rules.

        <DocNote>
          Card numbers never touch our servers, provider payloads are never
          persisted, and the customer reference is stored only as a
          non-joinable pseudonym. Revenue aggregates are readable over the
          API by the site owner; individual transactions never leave the
          dashboard.
