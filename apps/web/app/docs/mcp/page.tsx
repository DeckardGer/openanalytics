        <p>
          The Model Context Protocol is how AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, and
          anything MCP-speaking) get tools. Connect Open Analytics and your
          agent can read your traffic, list your sites, and, where you
          granted it, manage funnels, event definitions, widgets and
          sharing, all in plain conversation.

      <DocSection title="Connecting">
        <p>Point your MCP client at the server:</p>
        <DocCode caption="MCP endpoint">{`${API_BASE_URL}/mcp`}</DocCode>
        <p>
          The client registers itself and sends you through an OAuth consent
          in the browser: you see the app&apos;s name and exactly which
          scopes it asks for, and you approve or deny. No API key ever
          changes hands. In Claude, add it as a custom connector with that
          URL; other clients take the URL in their MCP settings.
