   * Serve AVIF where the browser says it can read it.
   *
   * The source files in `public/` are AVIF now, which is what makes the repo
   * and the deploy small. This line is the other half: without it Next's
   * default is `["image/webp"]`, so every browser — including the ones that
   * asked for AVIF in their `Accept` header — would be handed a WebP
   * transcode of an AVIF original, paying the conversion and losing the
   * format's advantage.
   *
   * It is also the answer to "does every browser support AVIF". Not quite:
   * Safari only from 16, and there are older Android WebViews. But the
   * optimizer negotiates per request, so a browser that never advertises
   * AVIF is served the WebP entry instead and no one sees a broken image.
   * The rule this depends on: every local image goes through `next/image`.
   * A raw `<img src="…​.avif">` would skip the negotiation and break on
   * exactly those old browsers, which is why the two `<img>` tags in this
   * app both point at external favicons rather than our own files.
