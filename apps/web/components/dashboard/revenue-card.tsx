/**
 * Revenue on the overview grid (M12, ADR-0033; frontend_tasks §23).
 *
 * **The empty states are the panel, not an edge case it also handles.** One
 * field decides which one you get — `meta.revenue.connection_status` — and a
 * zero is never allowed to stand in for any of them:
 *
 * - `not_connected` — nothing here is a number about this site, so the card
 *   shows a door rather than a `0`.
 * - `connected` with zero totals — the one real zero: no sales in this range.
 * - `degraded` — a warning **and** the figures. Blanking the card or showing
 *   zero during a provider outage is the exact failure this milestone was
 *   built to prevent: £0 is a claim about the business, and an outage is a
 *   claim about the pipe.
 * - `disconnected` — the recorded history, labelled as history.
 *
 * **Owner-only, gated on the role rather than on a probe.** `revenue:read` is
 * owner-only and an admin gets a 403 on all four reads, so the card is not
 * rendered for them at all — letting the 403 decide would flash an error on
 * every admin's dashboard load, once per visit, forever.
 *
 * Money is integer minor units plus a currency and nothing is pre-divided:
 * the average order value is `charge_gross_minor / charge_count`, computed
 * here, and `formatMoney` scales by the currency's own exponent because a
 * minor unit is not always a hundredth.
