/**
 * Integrations — the Stripe half is real (M12, ADR-0033; frontend_tasks §24).
 *
 * **This is a different door from the Revenue card.** Connecting is
 * `credentials:manage`, so owner *and* admin; reading a number out of it is
 * `revenue:read`, owner-only. An admin may wire Stripe up and never see a
 * total. A viewer sees the panel read-only rather than not at all — hiding it
 * would make the screen lie about what the site has.
 *
 * **The catalog is the feature probe.** `POST` and `PATCH` are registered only
 * where the deployment holds a credential keyring, so they answer `404` where
 * it has none while the catalog, `GET` and `DELETE` keep working. A `404` from
 * connect therefore means "this build cannot connect a provider", never a bad
 * site id — the same shape as the imports probe.
 *
 * **Connecting is two steps and the screen is built as two.** The signing
 * secret is deliberately absent from the connect body because it does not
 * exist yet: it can only be obtained after creating an endpoint at the
 * `webhook_url` that the connect call itself mints. Between the steps the
 * connection is `active` and **already ingesting** — the backfill and reconcile
 * sweeps run on the API key alone — so step one is never rendered as an error
 * or a half-broken state. A customer who closes the tab in between comes back
 * to a connection that works and a screen that still asks for the secret.
