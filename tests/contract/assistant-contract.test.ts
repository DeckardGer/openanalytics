/**
 * The assistant surface, at the contract level (ADR-0046).
 *
 * Two kinds of assertion, the shape `read-key-contract.test.ts` established:
 *
 * - **Type-level pins** on the generated `paths`/`components`. Deleting a path
 *   or narrowing a response fails `pnpm run typecheck`, not only this file, and
 *   a type pin cannot be satisfied by a comment that happens to contain the
 *   right words.
 * - **Block-scoped string assertions** on the YAML. Each one slices out the one
 *   block it is about before looking inside it, because a whole-document
 *   `toContain` proves only that some *other* endpoint has the property.
 *
 * `POST /v1/assistant/questions` is an event stream, and OpenAPI 3.1 has no
 * vocabulary for one — so it is documented the way `GET /v1/realtime/stream`
 * already is (a `200` whose schema is `type: string`, whose named events are
 * prose), and it is asserted here the way that endpoint already is.
