 * exists, so the WordPress plugin can be built against a mock.
 *
 * Two kinds of assertion, deliberately:
 *
 * - **Type-level pins** on the generated `paths`/`components`. Deleting a path,
 *   renaming a scope or narrowing a response shape fails `pnpm run typecheck`,
 *   not just this file — and a type pin cannot be satisfied by a comment that
 *   happens to contain the right words.
 * - **Block-scoped string assertions** on the YAML. Each one slices out the one
 *   path block it is about before looking inside it, because a whole-document
 *   `toContain` proves only that some other endpoint has the property.
