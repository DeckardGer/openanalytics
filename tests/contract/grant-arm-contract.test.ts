/**
 * The grant arm, as the contract describes it (ADR-0048 D2).
 *
 * **This file exists because `pnpm contracts:check` structurally cannot catch
 * what it is about.** That check regenerates `api.ts` from the spec and
 * compares it to the committed copy, so it proves the *types* match the
 * document — and `openapi-typescript` emits nothing at all for `security`. A
 * spec that declared every business route open to an OAuth grant, or none of
 * them, would pass it either way. The drift it cannot see is exactly the drift
 * that matters here: the allowlist is the whole safety argument, and a contract
 * that misdescribes it is a contract that tells an integrator they may do
 * something the server will refuse — or, worse, that they may not do something
 * the server allows, which is how a permission surface stops being reviewed.
 *
 * So the two are compared directly: `GRANT_WRITE_ALLOWLIST` in
 * `apps/api/src/http/grant-arm.ts` against the `oauthAccessToken` entries in
 * `openapi.yaml`, on both method and scope, in both directions.
