/**
 * The Stripe revenue adapter's semantics (ADR-0033, D1/D4/D5).
 *
 * Three things are proven here and each is load-bearing somewhere else:
 *
 * 1. **The consumed allowlist is exactly D4's**, and everything outside it is
 *    `ignored` with a *category* rather than an error. An unknown type answered
 *    with a 4xx would make a customer's Stripe dashboard show a permanently
 *    failing endpoint for events we correctly do not care about.
 * 2. **Amounts are integer passthrough.** Every amount comes from one of
 *    Stripe's own integer minor-unit fields; nothing is parsed from a decimal or
 *    multiplied by 100, and a non-integer is refused rather than rounded. A
 *    rounded amount is a wrong number that looks exactly like a right one.
 * 3. **The snapshot time is the event's, not the object's** — for webhooks. That
 *    is what lets two states of one charge be ordered at all; the object's
 *    `created` never moves, so using it would collapse every update into a
 *    permanent equal-timestamp tie.
