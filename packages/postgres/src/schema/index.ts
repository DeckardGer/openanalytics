/**
 * Schema barrel.
 *
 * Re-exports only table objects (never the `_shared` column builders), because
 * this is what the Drizzle client is handed as its `schema` for relational
 * queries. Each table also carries the Drizzle mirror of a raw-SQL migration in
 * `packages/postgres/migrations`; the SQL is the DDL source of truth (ADR-0006),
 * and the bootstrap test asserts the two do not drift.
 *
 * PRODUCT tables only. The cloud stream's tables (billing assignments,
 * subscriptions, trial, usage windows, webhook_events) mirror under
 * `packages/postgres/src/cloud/schema` with their own barrel.
