/**
 * The sites an attribution pass should consider.
 *
 * Three triggers, and the third one is not optional — it is the only way two of

 *
 *   1. **An object head of ANY KIND changed after the watermark.** A new
 *      purchase, a refund, a dispute opening or closing, a reconcile
 *      re-observation. This is the immediate path, and it is what makes a fresh
 *      purchase attributable — and a fresh refund *subtractable* — within one
 *      tick.
 *
 *      It was charge-only until M12 CP7, and the live proof found what that
 *      cost. CP4 wrote this predicate when the pass did exactly one job,
 *      attribution, and only a charge owns a journey — so charge-only was
 *      correct then. CP5 gave the same pass a **second** job, the rollup swap,
 *      whose inputs are refunds and disputes as much as charges, and did not
 *      widen the predicate to match. In production a refund at 00:21 left
 *      `revenue_1h` at its old generation with `refund_minor` at 0 until an
 *      unrelated charge at 00:32 dragged the site back into discovery. Net was
 *      overstated for eleven minutes, and on a site with no further charge
 *      activity it would have stayed overstated until the staleness clause below
 *      fired — up to a whole refresh interval.
 *
 *      Nothing downstream needed changing: CP5's B3 had already widened the
 *      rollup floor to `readOldestChangedRevenueObjectOccurrence`, and the
 *      affected-bucket set has always been kind-blind, so a pass that RUNS
 *      rebuilds the bucket correctly. The hole was that the pass did not run.
 *   2. **A checkout hint changed after the watermark.** `checkout.session.
 *      completed` can arrive after the charge was already attributed `none`;
 *      the hint carries D6's second matching signal and nothing on the charge
 *      side moves when it lands.
 *   3. **The watermark is older than the refresh interval.** Conversion events
 *      live in `events_raw` and session facts in `session_facts_versions` —
 *      both ClickHouse, neither visible to a Postgres discovery query at any
 *      price. A conversion event may be 24 h late (D-016) and the session that
 *      is its touchpoint is not finalized until inactivity plus that lateness
 *      has passed, so the *only* honest way to notice either is to re-run the
 *      site periodically. That is what this clause is, and the run it triggers
 *      is cheap by construction: the horizon is bounded and the planner writes
 *      nothing when no fingerprint moved.
 *
 * A site with no revenue objects and no hints is never returned, so the sweep
 * costs nothing on an installation with no revenue connections. Dropping the
 * kind filter does not widen that set at all: a site with a refund necessarily
 * holds the charge the refund points at, so the same sites are returnable — only
 * *when* they are returned moves.
 *
 * Ordered by site id and bounded, for the projection loop's reason: an arbitrary
 * order would make a starved site's starvation depend on physical layout.
