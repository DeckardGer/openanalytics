/**
 * Revenue ingest storage — the delivery ledger, the object head and the sync
 * cursors (ADR-0033, D4; migration 0034).
 *
 * Three write paths live here and they are deliberately in one module, because
 * they are one guarantee spelled three ways. The acceptance criterion this
 * milestone is graded on — *a duplicate or out-of-order provider event never
 * counts twice* — is enforced at two independent layers that compose:
 *
 * 1. **Delivery idempotency** (`recordRevenueProviderEvent`). `(site, provider,
 *    event_id)` is unique; a redelivery of an already-`processed` event
 *    short-circuits without redoing the work. A row a crash left `received` is
 *    safely reprocessed, because layer 2 is itself idempotent.
 * 2. **State idempotency and ordering** (`applyRevenueObservation`). The object
 *    head is read `FOR UPDATE`, the pure three-way decision runs against it, and
 *    the write happens in the *same* transaction. Deciding from a read taken in
 *    an earlier transaction is precisely the race ADR-0021 had to fix on the
 *    billing side; it is not repeated here.
 *
 * The site dimension is what separates this from M3's ledger: the same Stripe
 * account connected to two OA sites processes one `evt_…` once **per site**.
 *
 * Nothing in this module ever sees a plaintext credential, a provider response
 * body or a raw email. It stores hashes, canonical snapshots and categorized
 * results.
 *
 * ## Known gap: a delivery stuck at `received` (CP2, recorded not fixed)
 *
 * When the tie-break re-fetch fails, the route answers 5xx and deliberately
 * leaves the ledger row `received` so the provider redelivers. That recovery
 * depends on the provider *continuing to retry*, and Stripe eventually stops —
 * after which the row stays `received` with nothing scanning for it.
 *
 * The consequence is bounded and is not silent data loss: the object head is
 * updated by every later observation of the same object, and the reconcile
 * sweep re-lists a trailing window regardless of the ledger, so a charge whose
 * delivery got stuck is repaired by the next sweep as long as it is inside that
 * window. What is genuinely lost is a *late* update to an object created outside
 * the sweep's window (see the note in the worker's `sync.ts`).
 *
 * `revenue_provider_events_unsettled_idx` exists so the sweep that closes this
 * is a cheap query rather than a table scan; it has **no consumer in CP2**, and
 * writing one now would mean deciding a re-drive policy before CP3's fact writer
 * exists to say what re-driving should produce.
 *
 * **Closed in CP3 as visibility rather than repair** (`failStuckRevenueDeliveries`
 * below, driven by the reconcile tick). The re-drive policy the note was waiting
 * on turned out to be "there is none, and there cannot be": the ledger stores a
 * `payload_hash` and never the body, so nothing is left to reprocess — and the
 * reconcile sweep already re-lists a trailing window regardless of the ledger,
 * which is the actual repair. What was missing was a row nobody counted, so the
 * sweep settles it `failed` with a categorized result and emits a metric.

/**
 * The backfill job type (ADR-0033, D4).
 *
 * Named here rather than at either end, the reason `SITE_DELETION_JOB_TYPE`
 * gives: the api's connect handler enqueues it and the worker's registry
 * executes it, and a literal in two places is a registry entry that silently
 * never fires.
 *
 * Its subject is a **credential** id, not a site id. The `jobs` table admits
 * that without change — `subject_id` is an untyped uuid — and the partial unique
 * on `(type, subject_id)` then means exactly what it should: **one live backfill
 * per credential**. Keying it on the site would have been wrong the day a site
 * connects a second provider, and keying it on nothing would let a reconnect
 * start a second ninety-day walk beside the first.
 */

/**
 * Enqueue a 90-day backfill for a credential at a given generation (D2e/D4).
 *
 * Takes an `Executor` so it composes into the connect and rotate transactions:
 * the credential row and the job that fills it commit together, and a crash
 * between them cannot leave a connected provider whose history nobody is
 * walking.
 *
 * ## The generation is the whole point of the signature
 *
 * `enqueueJob`'s idempotency key is permanent — it matches a job in *any*
 * status, including `failed_terminal`. A key of `revenue_backfill:{credential}`
 * would therefore be **spent forever** the first time a walk gave up, and
 * `enqueued: false` would then be indistinguishable from "already running". That
 * is not a theoretical failure: a restricted key created with `Charges` read but
 * not `Disputes` passes the connect probe (which reads charges) and terminals
 * the walk on the third resource, at which point the customer's ninety days
 * become unrecoverable while the read surface still reports a connection.
 *
 * So the key carries `revenue_credentials.backfill_generation`, and the counter
 * is bumped by every event that means "try again with something new": a key
 * rotation, and `requestRevenueBackfill` below. What still holds is the *safety*
 * property — `jobs_live_subject_key` is a partial unique on
 * `(type, subject_id)` over the live statuses, so a bump while a walk is running
 * enqueues nothing rather than starting a second concurrent walk over the same
 * cursors.
 *
 * A disconnect-and-reconnect needs no bump: it mints a new credential id, which
 * is a different subject and a different key.

 * mark heads whose rows were never written, and a marker — unlike a watermark —
 * never comes back on its own.
 *
 * Three properties make the statement race-free, against two different racers:
 *
 * 1. The **literal** version that was projected is written, not the column. If

 * 2. The update is guarded `WHERE projected_version < literal`, so a marker can
 *    only ever move forward. A retry of the same batch after a later batch
 *    already advanced the row is a no-op rather than a rewind.
 * 3. The update additionally requires **`projection_epoch` to be unchanged**,
 *    which is what stops a re-materialization that landed mid-batch from being
 *    silently undone. Property 2 alone does not cover it:
 *    `resetRevenueProjection` zeroes the marker, and `0 < 3` satisfies that
 *    guard perfectly, so the batch would mark a head it had projected under the
 *    *old* reporting currency and nothing would ever pick it up again. Migration
 *    0035 walks the interleaving through step by step.
 *
 * Returns how many rows actually moved, which is what the caller reports: a
 * batch whose marks all no-op is a duplicate run or a reset that overtook it,
 * and that is worth being able to see.

/**
 * Reset a site's projection markers — the D2c re-materialization hook, **now
 * complete** (CP5 closes CP3's `TODO(CP5)`).
 *
 * Changing a site's `reporting_currency` makes every stored reporting amount
 * wrong, and D2c is explicit that the remedy is a **recompute, not a
 * re-ingest**: the heads are untouched and correct, only their projection is
 * stale. One statement expresses that exactly, because the marker is per row —
 * a timestamp watermark would have needed a rewind whose meaning depends on
 * clocks that were never reliable in the first place.
 *
 * ## The version bump is the whole reason this was not callable before
 *
 * CP3 shipped this function with no caller, and said why in as many words: it
 * reset the marker without bumping `version`, so a re-materialized fact **tied**
 * with the row it was meant to replace. A tie under `ReplacingMergeTree(version)`
 * is not merely "an arbitrary winner" — `argMax` is evaluated **per column**, so
 * one read could resolve `reporting_currency` from one version and
 * `reporting_gross_minor` from the other and return a row that never existed: a
 * EUR label beside a USD amount, with the answer free to change between two
 * identical queries as parts merge. That is a fabricated number, not a cosmetic
 * race.
 *
 * The `version + 1` below is what removes the hazard. It is safe against the
 * head's own writer: `applyRevenueObservation` mints `stored.version + 1` under
 * a `FOR UPDATE` lock and compares **snapshot times**, never versions, so a
 * version that jumped by one out from under it changes nothing about which
 * observation wins. Monotonicity — the only property ClickHouse cares about — is
 * preserved, and it is preserved per row rather than per site, so heads that
 * disagreed about their version before this call still disagree by the same
 * amount after it.
 *
 * ## Three writes, one statement, and each is load-bearing
 *
 * - `version + 1` — the restated fact supersedes rather than ties (above).
 * - `projected_version = 0` — the head becomes due again, under a predicate with
 *   no clock in it.
 * - `projection_epoch + 1` — refuses the mark of a batch that read these heads
 *   *before* the reset and would otherwise re-mark them as projected under the
 *   superseded currency.
 *
 * `updated_at` moves with them (the head is genuinely a new document from the
 * projection's point of view), which is also what makes the site discoverable by
 * the attribution job on its next tick.
 *
 * ## What it still does not do, by design
 *
 * It does not re-roll buckets older than the attribution job's rolling horizon.
 * Facts are the projection's problem; buckets are the rollup's, and the caller
 * must set `revenue_attribution_state.rollup_recompute_from` in the same
 * transaction (`markRevenueRollupRecompute`) or a year of history keeps its
 * amounts in the previous currency forever. Migration 0037 argues that at
 * length, including why the horizon's oldest-changed-head escape hatch is a race
 * rather than a free answer.
 *
 * ## Cost, and the operational caveat CP7 inherits
 *
 * This is one `UPDATE` over every head a site owns, inside the HTTP transaction
 * that changed the setting. Two things keep it as small as it can be: it counts
 * rows through the driver's `rowCount` rather than `RETURNING` every id (a large
 * account would otherwise ship a hundred thousand uuids back to a request that
 * wants a number), and the caller runs it **last**, after the `sites` row is
 * already updated, so the `FOR UPDATE` lock on that row is held for the shortest
 * span the ordering allows.
 *
 * What is NOT solved here: on a very large account this is a multi-second — in
 * the limit, multi-minute — transaction on a synchronous request. Moving it to
 * the job runner would be the real fix and would also break the "both halves or
 * neither" guarantee that makes the currency change safe at all, so it stays
 * transactional and the cost is recorded as a CP7 operational caveat rather than
 * redesigned under a review deadline. A currency change is a rare, deliberate,
 * owner-initiated action.

 *
 * ## What leaves a row `received`
 *
 * The webhook route answers 5xx and deliberately does not settle the ledger row
 * when a tie-break re-fetch fails, so the provider redelivers and the redelivery
 * finds an unsettled row and tries again. That recovery depends on the provider
 * *continuing* to retry, and Stripe eventually stops — after which the row stays
 * `received` with nothing scanning for it. `revenue_provider_events_unsettled_idx`
 * has existed since CP2 for exactly this scan and had no consumer until now.
 *
 * ## Why this does not re-drive anything
 *
 * **The reconcile sweep is the repair path.** It re-lists a trailing window on a
 * timer, both paths land in the same object head, and an object whose delivery
 * got stuck is repaired by the next sweep as long as it is inside that window.
 * Re-driving from here would be a second writer racing the first for no gain,
 * and it could not succeed anyway: the ledger stores a `payload_hash`, never the
 * body (D5's privacy boundary), so there is nothing left to reprocess. What was
 * missing was not a repair, it was *knowing it happened* — a row nobody counts.
 *
 * So the sweep marks the row `failed` with a categorized result and the caller
 * emits a metric. A sustained non-zero rate means tie-break re-fetches are
 * failing faster than the provider retries, which is a credential or a provider
 * problem an operator can act on; a zero rate means the 5xx path is doing what
 * it was designed to do.
 *
 * Bounded by `limit` for the reason every sweep in this repository is bounded: a
 * backlog that accumulated over a weekend must not turn one tick into a
 * table-length transaction inside a process that is also ingesting events.
