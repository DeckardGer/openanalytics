/**
 * Account deletion's Postgres half (ADR-0030, decision 8).
 *
 * The shape mirrors `site-deletion.ts` — a small synchronous start transaction
 * owned by the API, a teardown transaction owned by the worker, and the reads
 * the phases between them need — because they are the same kind of object: a
 * durable, resumable erasure whose progress lives in `deletion_requests` and
 * `deletion_targets` rather than in a process.
 *
 * What is different is that an account owns no data of its own. Every event, row
 * and Redis key belongs to a *site*, and this deletion's first job is therefore
 * not to purge anything but to establish that the sites are already being
 * handled — either handed to somebody else, or deleted by their own jobs with
 * their own targets. That is what the gate below is, and it is the reason
 * account deletion has eighteen Postgres targets and no ClickHouse ones at all.
 *
 * **The users row is scrubbed, not deleted, and that is not a shortcut.**
 * `site_billing_assignments.billing_user_id` is `NOT NULL` with the default
 * `RESTRICT`, and those rows are the billing history of sites that may now
 * belong to somebody else entirely. Deleting the user to free the row would
 * either fail or falsify another customer's record. So the row survives as a
 * tombstone that identifies nobody: `deleted-{id}@tombstone.invalid`, an empty
 * name, no image, no timezone.
 *
 * **Better Auth interplay.** There is no cookie cache in this deployment
 * (`packages/auth/src/better-auth.ts`), so a session is resolved by reading the
 * `sessions` row on every request: deleting those rows ends the session on the
 * caller's very next call, with no window in which a cached cookie still
 * authenticates. The scrubbed email cannot collide with any Better Auth flow —
 * `users_email_key` stays satisfied because the tombstone address embeds the
 * user id, and the `verifications` rows that addressed the old address are
 * removed *before* the scrub, while they can still be found. Signing in
 * afterwards with the original address is a fresh, empty account (the one-door
 * model), and it gets no second free trial: the `trial_claims` row keeps its
 * `identity_hash` forever and only its link to the account is severed (D-021).
 */

/**
 * The topic the finished erasure announces.
 *
 * Observe-only, exactly like `site.deletion_completed` and for the same reason:

 * drained rather than one that grows forever.

 * Begin an account deletion — the start transaction (ADR-0030, D8).

 *    is safe to add is that nothing else in the codebase locks a `users` row:
 *    there is no existing holder to form a cycle with. It serializes two
 *    concurrent deletions of the same account, which would otherwise both pass
 *    the gate and both write a request.
 * 2. **Take a locking read of the sites this user pays for**, as
 *    `SELECT … WHERE owner_user_id = … ORDER BY id FOR UPDATE`. The
 *    `ORDER BY` is inside the locking SELECT because Postgres acquires row locks
 *    in executor scan order and sorting the result afterwards would order
 *    nothing (ADR-0030, D4's lock-order canon). Without this lock the gate is a
 *    plain read, and a handover-accept committing between the read and this
 *    commit would hand the user a freshly billed site *after* it was checked.
 *    No subscription lock is taken here, so the canon's "subscription before
 *    site" rule has nothing to violate — this transaction simply never appears
 *    in the ordering that rule exists to fix.
 * 3. **Run both gate checks.** Blocked → throw with the full list; nothing has
 *    been written, so the throw is the whole outcome.
 * 4. **Idempotency.** A pending/running account request for this user is
 *    returned as-is. A second `DELETE /v1/me` therefore reports the first
 *    deletion rather than minting a twin whose target snapshot would disagree.
 * 5. **Write the request, the target snapshot and the job in this transaction.**
 *    A request with no job is an erasure nobody is performing and no sweep can
 *    find.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately *not* here. **Sessions are not revoked**: the
 * caller's own session stays valid until `postgres_teardown` deletes the row,
 * seconds later. Revoking here would mean the 202 could not be read by the
 * client that asked for it, and would put a second writer on a table the
 * teardown already owns — for the sake of a window whose only occupant is the
 * person who just asked to be deleted. **Stripe is not called**: an HTTP call to
 * a third party inside a transaction that can still roll back would cancel a
 * subscription for a deletion that never happened.

 * One transaction because the ownership triggers are `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
 * DEFERRED` and fire at commit: the membership deletions and everything that
 * follows them have to be judged together. It is also what makes the phase
 * atomic in the way an erasure has to be — there is no committed state in which
 * the account's sessions are gone but its subscription row survives.
 *
 * **The gate is re-run here, inside this transaction**, and throws
 * `AccountDeletionBlockedError` when the account has become a live site's payer
 * or sole owner since the request was made. The start's check was a different
 * transaction and cannot cover the days in between; this one shares a commit
 * with the deletes, so there is no window between passing it and erasing.
 *
 * The order inside it has exactly one load-bearing step. **`verifications` are
 * deleted first, keyed on the address the account holds right now**, because the
 * scrub at the end rewrites that address and the rows would become unfindable —
 * the table is keyed by identifier, and nothing else records which account a
 * verification belonged to.
 *
 * Two steps are deliberately not deletes:
 *
 * - **Transfer offers are cancelled, not deleted.** A pending offer involving
 *   this account must die — accepting one afterwards would hand a site to, or
 *   take a site from, somebody who no longer exists — but the offer *history* is
 *   the audit trail of who tried to move billing for a site that in most cases
 *   still belongs to somebody else. Setting `status = 'cancelled'` with
 *   `responded_at` satisfies the table's own `responded_check` and keeps the
 *   record; deleting the rows would erase another customer's history to tidy up
 *   this one's.
 * - **Trial claims are unlinked, not deleted.** `identity_hash` is the D-021
 *   one-time-trial tombstone and outlives every account by design. What is
 *   severed is the link: `user_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` both nulled —
 *   the second closes the gap 02 §8 notes, where a deleted account left a live
 *   Stripe id in a table that is supposed to hold no account data.
 *
 * Invitations get the same treatment from two directions. Invitations this
 * account *sent* have `invited_by_user_id` nulled, so no live invitation names a
 * tombstone as its inviter. Invitations sent *to* this account's address are
 * left alone: they are addressed to an email, not to a user, whoever controls
 * that address may still accept them, and they expire on their own. Deleting
 * them would silently cancel another site owner's invitation as a side effect of
 * this account's erasure.
 *
 * `usage_windows`, `usage_batch_deltas`, `site_billing_assignments` and
 * `audit_logs` are untouched — metering, billing and audit history that ADR-0030
 * D8 keeps deliberately, and the reason the users row is a tombstone at all.
 *
 * Every step tolerates a re-run: the deletes remove nothing the second time, the
 * cancellation matches no `pending` rows, the unlink writes the nulls already
 * there, and the scrub rewrites the tombstone address to itself.
