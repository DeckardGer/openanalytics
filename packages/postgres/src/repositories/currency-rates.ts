/**
 * Currency reference rates (ADR-0033, D2c; migration 0034).
 *
 * **Global data.** There is no `site_id` in this table and no site-scoped
 * function in this module, which is the whole point: these are the ECB's
 * published rates, shared by every site's conversions, and the deletion
 * vocabulary deliberately excludes them (`deletion.ts` says so where a reader
 * would otherwise assume an omission).
 *
 * Rates are handled as **strings** end to end — parsed out of the ECB document
 * as an exact decimal, stored in a `numeric` column, read back as a string. A
 * rate is one multiplication away from money, and float money has been
 * forbidden since M0 (`packages/contracts/src/money.ts`, 03 §6.5). The one place
 * a number appears in this module is a row count.

 * `ON CONFLICT (rate_date, currency) DO UPDATE` rather than `DO NOTHING`, and
 * that is the weekend behaviour rather than an edge case: the ECB republishes
 * the previous banking day's file on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, so the
 * loop legitimately sees the same `(date, currency)` several days running. An
 * update refreshes `fetched_at` — which is how "our rate table is being kept
 * alive" stays distinguishable from "our rate table stopped being written to"
 * on a long holiday weekend, when `rate_date` alone would look identically
 * stale in both cases.
 *
 * One statement rather than a loop: thirty-one rows is one round trip, and a
 * partial write here would leave a day half-converted with nothing to say so.
