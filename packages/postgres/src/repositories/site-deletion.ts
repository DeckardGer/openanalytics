/**
 * Site deletion's Postgres half (ADR-0030, decision 4).
 *
 * Two transactions and a handful of reads, split by who runs them:
 *
 * - `startSiteDeletion` is the **API's** transaction. It is small, synchronous
 *   and the only place a site enters `deleting`. Everything it does is a
 *   promise: the site stops accepting events, its credentials stop working, its
 *   caches become unreachable, and a durable job exists to do the rest.
 * - `purgeSitePostgres` is the **worker's** transaction, one phase of the job.
 * - the rest are the reads the phases need — the drain's in-flight count, the
 *   target state machine, the finalizer's status fence — kept here rather than
 *   in the executor so the SQL is testable without a worker.
 *
 * The invariant that ties them together: nothing outside `startSiteDeletion`
 * writes `sites.status = 'deleting'`, and nothing outside `finalizeSiteDeletion`
 * writes `'deleted'`. Two writers of a lifecycle transition is how a site ends
 * up half-deleted with no job to finish it.

/**
 * Begin a site deletion — the "deletion start" transaction (ADR-0030, D4).
 *
 * One transaction, and the order inside it is the guarantee. If
 * the process dies at any point before the commit, nothing happened; after it,
 * every one of the promises below is durable together:
 *
 * 1. **Lock the site row `FOR UPDATE`.** One site, so the multi-row lock-order
 *    canon (ADR-0030 D4: `ORDER BY id` *inside* the locking SELECT, because
 *    Postgres acquires row locks in executor scan order) has nothing to order
 *    here — but the lock itself is not optional. `registerBatchSites` takes the
 *    same lock before reading `ingest_generation` and writing its fence
 *    registration, so this lock is what makes "bump the generation" and "check
 *    the generation" serialize instead of interleaving. A worker that read the
 *    old generation cannot then register under it after this commits.
 * 2. **Already `deleting` → return the existing request.** The route answers 202
 *    with the same id, so a double-click, a retried request and a sweeper racing
 *    an operator all converge on one deletion. `deleted` is an error the route
 *    turns into a 404: the tombstone is not a site.
 * 3. **Write the request and its full target snapshot.** The snapshot is what
 *    the worker works; see `SITE_DELETION_TARGETS` for why it is snapshotted
 *    rather than derived at execution time. `requested_at` is left to the
 *    column's `DEFAULT now()` — the *database's* clock — because the worker's
 *    `fence_drain` compares it against an elapsed interval. Stamping it from the
 *    calling host's `Date.now()` would put a third clock into a comparison
 *    `DELETION_ACCEPTANCE_MARGIN_MS` only budgets skew for two of, and a fast
 *    api host would shorten a wait that exists to prevent data loss. Tests pass
 *    `now` explicitly and get a deterministic instant.
 * 4. **Enqueue the job in the same transaction.** The one statement that makes
 *    this safe at all: a commit that marked the site `deleting` without a job
 *    would leave a site nobody is deleting, invisible to every sweep (the
 *    retention sweeper only looks at `suspended` rows).
 * 5. **Flip the site.** `status = 'deleting'` stops the collector at the fence,
 *    `ingest_generation + 1` invalidates every config snapshot a request already
 *    holds — which is what the drain then waits out — and `config_version + 1`
 *    makes every cached read (tracker config ETag, collector ingest-config
 *    cache, gateway query cache keyed on `cache_epoch`) unreachable.
 * 6. **Revoke every live key, erase every provider credential, and audit it.** A
 *    tracking key that still worked would keep a browser posting events at a
 *    site being erased; a revenue credential still holding its ciphertext would
 *    leave a decryptable key to a customer's payment provider sitting in a
 *    database for the whole length of a purge (ADR-0033, D8).
 *
 * The realtime epoch bump itself is deliberately *not* here. It is a Redis side
 * effect and must not run inside a transaction that can still roll back; the
 * route does it after the commit, best-effort, exactly as member removal does.
 * What *is* here is the durable half of the same revocation: a
 * `realtime.access_revoked` outbox row on the reserved site subject, written in
 * this transaction so the bump survives an unreachable Redis, a crash between
 * commit and side effect, and a start that no route ran at all (the retention
 * sweeper's). Without it, a deletion started while the cache was down would
 * leave every open stream on the site connected until its token expired.
