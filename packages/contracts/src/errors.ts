  // An operator has suspended this site, so the surfaces that read its
  // analytics are closed until it is restored. Its own code rather than
  // `FORBIDDEN` because the caller's permissions are not the problem and
  // nothing they can do to their own membership will help: the recovery is a
  // state change on the site, and a client that branches on this shows the
  // site's own banner rather than an authorization error.
  'SITE_SUSPENDED',

  // Resource and request shape
  'SITE_NOT_FOUND',
  'NOT_FOUND',
  'VALIDATION_FAILED',
  'PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE',
  'IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT',
  // The address already belongs to a member of this site. Split out of
  // IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT because the two 409s on the invite routes need
  // different words and different recovery: "an invite is already pending for
  // this address" (revoke or resend it) versus "this person is already on the
  // team" (nothing to do).
  'ALREADY_MEMBER',
  // The account cannot be deleted yet because sites still depend on this user
  // (ADR-0030, decision 8). Not a FORBIDDEN — the caller is allowed to delete
  // their account, the account is simply not in a deletable state — and not a
  // VALIDATION_FAILED, because nothing about the request is wrong. The remedy is
  // a sequence of other operations (hand the site over, or delete it), and
  // `details.blocking_sites` names each one and which of the two it needs.
  'ACCOUNT_DELETION_BLOCKED',
  // A site may hold exactly one non-terminal import run (ADR-0032, D3), so
  // starting a second one — or acting on a run that has moved past the state the
  // action needs — is a conflict with the site's current state, not a bad
  // request. Its own code because the recovery is specific and nameable: publish
  // or discard the run that is already there. `details.import_run_id` names it.
  'IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS',
  // `complete` was called and the object is not in the bucket. Distinct from
  // IMPORT_FAILED, which means the archive was there and could not be used: this
  // one says the upload itself never landed, and the recovery is to PUT again
  // through the signed URL rather than to fix the file.
  'IMPORT_UPLOAD_MISSING',
  // The run is the published one and its predecessor can no longer be restored:
  // cleanup keeps exactly ONE rollback generation (ADR-0032, D3), and this run's
  // is already erased. Deliberately not IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS, which says "the run
  // is not in a state that admits this" and would send a client looking at the
  // phase — the phase here is exactly right, and it is the *predecessor* that is
  // gone. There is no recovery: the honest client behaviour is to stop offering
  // the rollback, which needs a code it can branch on.
  'IMPORT_ROLLBACK_UNAVAILABLE',
  // A site may hold one live export at a time (ADR-0032, D8 — the job runner's
  // `(type, subject_id)` liveness index), and a download may only be minted for
  // one that succeeded. Both are conflicts with the export's current state
  // rather than bad requests, and they share a code for the same reason the
  // three import states do: the client's branch is "look at `details.phase` and
  // wait", and splitting "another export is running" from "this export has not
  // finished" would give it two names for one recovery.
  'EXPORT_IN_PROGRESS',
  // The objects are gone. `exports/` expires after seven days (ADR-0032, D1) and
  // the run is flipped to `expired` lazily at the moment somebody asks for a
  // download. Deliberately NOT a 404: the export existed, the customer's memory
  // of it is correct, and the recovery is specific — request a new export. A 404
  // would send them looking for a wrong id. Deliberately not EXPORT_IN_PROGRESS
  // either: nothing is in progress and waiting will never help.
  'EXPORT_EXPIRED',
  // A site holds one live revenue credential per provider (ADR-0033, D3), so
  // connecting a second one is a conflict with the site's current state rather
  // than a bad request. Its own code because the recovery is nameable and
  // specific — disconnect the connection that is already there, or rotate its
  // key — and neither of those is what a client does about an
  // `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
  'REVENUE_ALREADY_CONNECTED',
  // The provider rejected the credential during the live connect/rotate probe
  // (ADR-0033, D3): a revoked or mistyped key, or a restricted key missing the
  // read permissions the adapter needs. Nothing is stored. Deliberately NOT
  // `VALIDATION_FAILED` — the request is well-formed and the field is exactly
  // what the customer meant to send; it is the provider that said no, and the
  // remedy is in the provider's dashboard rather than in the form. Deliberately
  // not `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` either: that one is retryable and this is not.
  'REVENUE_CREDENTIAL_REJECTED',
  'RATE_LIMITED',
  // The declared range is wider than this surface's ceiling (ADR-0043, D7). Its
  // own code rather than `VALIDATION_FAILED` because the request is well-formed
  // and the recovery is exact and automatable — ask for a narrower window and
  // page — while a validation failure tells a client its parameters are
  // malformed, which sends an integrator looking for a typo that is not there.
  // Deliberately not `RATE_LIMITED` either: nothing about waiting helps, and a
  // `Retry-After` would be a lie.
  'RANGE_TOO_LARGE',
  // The requested range/timezone/grain combination has no rollup that can answer
  // it honestly — a sub-hour timezone at hour/day grain (docs snapshot 02 §15).
  // Client-correctable: pick minute grain, a shorter range, or a whole-hour zone.
  'RESOLUTION_NOT_AVAILABLE',
  // An event definition's name is already used on this site (ADR-0034, D3).
  // Its own code rather than IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT because the recovery is
  // nameable and specific -- pick another name, or edit the definition that
  // already owns this one -- and because the name is not free even when the
  // other definition is archived: the ClickHouse rows it produced still group
  // under it, so "archive it and retry" is NOT the remedy a client should infer.
  'EVENT_DEFINITION_NAME_TAKEN',
  // Someone else published a different version of this definition between the
  // caller reading it and acting (ADR-0034, D3). Deliberately not a generic
  // conflict: the client's recovery is exact and automatable -- re-read the
  // definition, show the user what is now live, and let them decide -- and
  // `details.published_version` is the value it needs to do that.
