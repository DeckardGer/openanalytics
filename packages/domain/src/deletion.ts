 * The deletion target vocabulary (ADR-0030, decision 7).
 *
 * A site deletion snapshots this list into `deletion_targets` at the instant it
 * starts, and the worker then works the snapshot rather than re-deriving it.
 * That is the whole reason the vocabulary is fixed and lives in one pure module:
 *
 * - **The snapshot is the contract.** A job resumed a week later purges what the
 *   customer's deletion promised to purge, not what a redeployed build happens
 *   to enumerate. If a future milestone adds a store, existing in-flight
 *   deletions keep their original target set and the new one is covered by the
 *   deletions started after it — which is auditable, whereas a live-derived list
 *   silently changes the meaning of a request already made.
 * - **Three packages must agree.** Postgres writes the snapshot rows, ClickHouse
 *   executes the thirty `ALTER … DELETE`s, and the worker matches phases to
 *   stores. A literal repeated in three places is a purge that quietly stops
 *   covering a table the day one of them is edited. A vocabulary name with no
 *   purge statement behind it is worse than an omission: it verifies silently at
 *   `deleted: 0`, so the per-table effect is asserted, not only the count.
 *
 * The list is deliberately *not* derived from `system.tables`, from the Drizzle
 * schema barrel or from the Redis key prefixes. Derivation would make every new
 * table a deletion target with nobody deciding that it should be, and — worse —
 * would make a renamed one silently stop being purged. Here, a table that is
 * missing is a verification error.

 * - M11 CP4 added the `export_runs` Postgres table (ADR-0032 D8) — 12 became

 * - M12 CP2 added the three ingest tables — `revenue_provider_events`,
 *   `revenue_objects`, `revenue_sync_state` (Postgres migration 0034) — 14
 *   became 17, so 48 became 51;
 * - M12 CP3 added `revenue_events` on the ClickHouse side (migration 0016) —
 *   28 became 29 — and `revenue_match_hints` on the Postgres side (migration
 *   0035) — 17 became 18 — so 51 became 53. The hints table is the one
 *   D8 did not book: the amendment recorded under D8 says why it exists and

 *   (migration 0036) — 18 became 19 — so 53 became **55**;

 *   became **57**, which is the milestone's end state (ADR-0033, D8 as amended
 *   by CP3). Redis stayed 5 and the object store stayed 1 throughout M12: the
 *   revenue surface persists no key and no cached value of its own;
 * - M13 CP1 added `event_definitions` and `event_definition_versions` (Postgres
 *   migration 0038) — 19 became 21, so 57 became **59**;
 * - M13 CP5 added `events_preview` on the ClickHouse side (migration 0020) — 32
 *   became 33, so 59 became **60**, which is the milestone's end state
 *   (ADR-0034, D9). Redis stayed 5 throughout — the event builder holds no key —
 *   and the object store stayed 1;
 * - ADR-0038 CP2 added `custom_event_samples_1h` and `custom_event_samples_1d`
 *   (migration 0021) — 33 became 35, so 60 became **62**. Two tables and not
 *   one, for the reason the rollup families are all pairs: an hour grain cannot
 *   answer a ninety-day range and a day grain cannot answer a two-hour one.
 *   Nothing else moved — the widened read adds no Postgres row, no Redis key
 *   and no object;
 * - M15 CP1 added `widgets` (Postgres migration 0048) — 21 became 22, so 62
 *   became **63** (ADR-0045, D8). One table and not two: a widget's origin
 *   allowlist is a bounded `text[]` on the row rather than a child table, so
 *   there is nothing beside it to enumerate. ClickHouse stayed 35 — a widget
 *   read computes through the existing public pipeline and persists no fact of
 *   its own — Redis stayed 5, and the object store stayed 1;
 * - M18's first work item added `credential_sources` (Postgres migration 0050)
 *   — 22 became 23, so 63 became **64** (ADR-0051, D5). One table and one
 *   target, even though the table also holds rows an account deletion removes:
 *   this vocabulary purges the `api_key` half by `site_id`, the account one
 *   purges the `oauth_grant` half by `user_id`, and the two never overlap
 *   because exactly one of those columns is set per row. ClickHouse stayed 35 —
 *   a credential event is a Postgres row and nothing else — Redis stayed 5, and
 *   the object store stayed 1.
 *
 * `currency_rates` (migration 0034) is deliberately **not** here and never will
 * be. It is global reference data — one row per `(rate_date, currency)`, with no
 * `site_id` column to purge by — and D2c says so explicitly. Deleting a site's
 * data must not delete the ECB's published exchange rates; they are not the
 * customer's bytes, they belong to every other site's conversions, and a target
 * naming a table with no site dimension could only ever be a delete-everything
 * statement or a no-op that verifies at `deleted: 0`.
 *
 * The `object` target did **not** multiply, which is the property that made it
 * one target instead of one per key: export chunks record their keys on
 * `export_runs` rows and join the one snapshotted key list beside the import
 * archives. Revenue adds no object target at all — provider payload bodies are
 * never persisted (ADR-0033, D5).
 *
 * Still no provider row: a site deletion cancels no subscription, because the
 * site is one of possibly several the same person is answerable for.
 *
 * **The array is appended to by `registerDeletionExtension`**, and every holder
 * of this binding sees those entries because it is the same array object. That
 * is the whole mechanism behind the composite dictionary: a surface that owns
 * tables of its own contributes its targets at import time, before anything
 * snapshots them, and neither the writer that stamps the snapshot nor the
 * executor that works it needs to know which surfaces a deployment mounted. The
 * appended entries land after the product's, which is a reading order rather
 * than an execution constraint — the whole snapshot is one transaction, and no
 * contributed table is referenced by a product one.

 *   `api_keys`. An account's `private_read` keys are secrets *this person*
 *   minted, but the rows are site-scoped and live on sites that are not being
 *   deleted — so nothing else in this snapshot would ever touch them, and a
 *   deleted account's token would keep reading a live customer's analytics.
 *   Revoked rather than deleted, because `api_keys` is what "who could read this
 *   site" is reconstructed from; the site's public `tracking_write` token is
 *   deliberately out of scope, being the site's credential and not the user's.
 * - `api_keys_rotation_required` is the disposition `api_keys_revoke` does not
 *   cover, added 2026-08-06 (ADR-0043, D8). Not every private key this person
 *   minted is revoked: one they installed into a machine (`held_by = 'site'` —
 *   the WordPress plugin's) stays alive on a site that now belongs to somebody
 *   else, because revoking it would take a working installation down over a
 *   departure. It is stamped `rotation_required_at` instead, so the site's
 *   remaining owners can see that a departed stranger still knows its value.
 *   It is a target rather than a silence for the reason `idempotency_keys` is
 *   one: a snapshot that reported only `api_keys_revoke` would read as "every
 *   key this account held is gone", and here that is exactly what did not
 *   happen. The two counts partition the same set.
 * - `revenue_credentials_revoke` is the same shape and the same argument, one
 *   milestone later (ADR-0033, D3/D8). A credential this person connected is a
 *   **customer's payment-provider key** living on a site that is not being
 *   deleted, so nothing else in this snapshot reaches it — and the sync loop
 *   would keep decrypting and using it forever on behalf of an account that no
 *   longer exists. It is disabled with both ciphertexts erased rather than
 *   deleted, because the row is the site's connection history and the site is
 *   still alive; the site's own `revenue_credentials` target (a delete) belongs
 *   to the *site* vocabulary and is a different set of rows, exactly as
 *   `api_keys` and `api_keys_revoke` are.
 * - `idempotency_keys` is a delete, added 2026-08-06, and it is here because a
 *   foreign key that looks like it already covers this does not. The column is
 *   `REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, and the cascade **never fires**:
 *   `user_tombstone` below scrubs the `users` row rather than deleting it, so
 *   nothing ever cascades from it. Meanwhile the rows hold `response_body` —
 *   the stored response a create replayed, which for `sites.create` carries the
 *   site's slug and name. A declared cascade that cannot run is worse than none,
 *   because it reads as coverage.
 * - `oauth_access_tokens`, `oauth_consents` and `device_codes` are three deletes,
 *   added 2026-08-06 with migration 0045, and they are here for exactly the
 *   reason `idempotency_keys` is — one milestone's lesson applied at the moment
 *   the tables were written rather than a year later. Every one of them is
 *   *a person's*: an access token that reads their sites' analytics, a standing
 *   consent naming what they let a client do, and any device authorization they
 *   have in flight. Better Auth's declared schema puts
 *   `ON DELETE CASCADE` on all three `user_id` columns and migration 0045
 *   deliberately omits it, because `user_tombstone` scrubs the `users` row and a
 *   cascade that cannot fire reads as coverage. Left out, a deleted account's
 *   CLI would keep reading a live customer's analytics until the token expired,
 *   and its refresh token would keep renewing it for a month.
 *
 *   `oauth_applications` is **not** a target, and since ADR-0047 the reason is
 *   construction rather than a disabled flag: dynamic client registration is
 *   live (`POST /v1/oauth/register`), but its writer never stamps `user_id` —
 *   a registered client introduces *itself* and belongs to nobody — so no
 *   user-owned row can exist and there is nothing for deletion to find. A dead
 *   user's tokens and consents die in the two targets above, which is what
 *   makes the surviving client row inert. The unit test that used to pin the
 *   registration flag now pins the anonymous write instead.
 * - `assistant_usage_ledger` is a delete, added 2026-08-08 with migration 0049
 *   (ADR-0046, D5), and it is enumerated in the same change that created the
 *   table rather than being discovered later. The rows hold no message text, no
 *   tool arguments and no answers — the server stores no conversation at all
 *   (D12) — only how many questions this person asked in an hour and what the
 *   tokens came to. Counts under a user id are still that user's data. The
 *   contrast with `read_cost_ledger`, which is in *neither* registry, is the
 *   whole distinction: that table is keyed by a credential and what survives it
 *   "is a number that describes nothing about anybody", while this one is keyed
 *   by a person. Its foreign key declares no `ON DELETE` action for the reason
 *   the three above give, so this statement is what actually removes the rows.
 * - `user_tombstone` is the scrub, not a delete. The `users` row survives
 *   because `site_billing_assignments.billing_user_id` is `NOT NULL RESTRICT`
 *   and that history belongs to the *surviving* site's owner (ADR-0030, D8).
 *
 * The order is the one the teardown transaction runs in, and one step of it is
 * load-bearing: `verifications` is keyed by the email *identifier*, so it must
 * be emptied before `user_tombstone` rewrites the email, or the rows become
 * unfindable. The rest could commute — they are one transaction — but a stable
 * order makes a partially-recorded snapshot readable by an operator, which is
 * why `api_keys_revoke` and `revenue_credentials_revoke` sit with the other
 * credential targets rather than at the end.
