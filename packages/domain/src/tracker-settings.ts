 * rather than as literals in the repository that happens to read the row.
 *
 * The tracker carries its own copy of these defaults for the first page load,
 * before any config request has completed (`apps/tracker/src/core.ts`). The two
 * must agree, or a visitor's first pageview would be tracked under different
 * rules from their second; `tests/tracker/config.test.ts` and the contract tests
