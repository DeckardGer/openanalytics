 * The scopes only an OAuth consent can confer (ADR-0048 D1).

 * separation is load-bearing three times over:
 *
 * - `KEY_SCOPES` is derived by filtering `READ_SCOPES`, so a scope that never
 *   enters that dictionary can never be minted onto a `private_read` key — by
 *   construction, not by remembering to extend an exclusion list.
 * - The device exchange narrows grants through `readScopesFromGrant`, which
 *   drops everything outside `READ_SCOPES`. The CLI therefore cannot acquire
 *   these scopes even if a device authorization asks for them — "the CLI stays
 *   exactly as it is" enforced by the same function that already enforces scope
 *   hygiene.
 * - `SESSION_SCOPES` on the read arm is a fixed literal; the assistant gains
 *   nothing.
 *
 * The only route to holding one of these is the authorization-code flow,
 * behind the consent screen — which is why their names are sentences a person
 * can decide about (`GRANT_SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS` below).
