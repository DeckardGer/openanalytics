/**
 * The revenue ingest vocabulary and the object-head decision (ADR-0033, D4).
 *
 * This module is the CP2 twin of `stripe-reconcile.ts`, and deliberately so: the
 * M3 billing webhook taught the repository that provider deliveries are neither
 * ordered nor exactly-once, and the answer it arrived at — a delivery ledger for
 * *redelivery* plus a three-way ordering decision for *out-of-order* — is
 * repeated here rather than re-invented. What changed is the grain. Billing
 * reconciles one subscription row per account; revenue reconciles one **object
 * head** per `(site, provider, object_id)`, because a Stripe account connected
 * to two OA sites must process the same charge once per site.
 *
 * ## Why a locally minted `version` exists at all
 *
 * `revenue_objects.version` is a monotonic counter this decision hands out, and
 * CP3's ClickHouse fact is `ReplacingMergeTree(version)` ordered by
 * `(site_id, provider, object_id)`. That is the entire reason it exists:
 *
 * - ClickHouse never needs a read-modify-write. The writer already knows which
 *   generation it is inserting, because Postgres decided it under a row lock.
 * - A duplicate insert of the *same* state is harmless — same version, same
 *   values, `argMax` picks either.
 * - An out-of-order insert cannot win. A stale observation is either skipped
 *   here (so it never reaches ClickHouse) or, if it somehow did, carries a lower
 *   version than the state that superseded it.
 *
 * Provider timestamps cannot do that job. Stripe's `created` is second-granular,
 * so two observations of one charge routinely share a second, and a version
 * derived from a timestamp would make two genuinely different states
 * indistinguishable. Hence the same equal-timestamp rule M3 landed on: **equal
 * time with a different payload is not a tie to be broken by guessing, it is a
 * re-fetch from the provider.**
 *
 * ## The decision is pure
 *
 * Nothing here reads or writes. The repository
 * (`packages/postgres/src/repositories/revenue-objects.ts`) holds the row
 * `FOR UPDATE`, calls this, and applies the answer inside the same transaction —
 * which is what makes "decide then write" atomic rather than merely sequential.
 * A decision taken from a read in an earlier transaction is exactly the race
 * ADR-0021 fixed on the billing side.

 *
 * - **No raw provider body.** The ledger stores a `payload_hash`; the body it
 *   hashed is never persisted (D5's privacy boundary). What survives is this
 *   structure, whose every field is here because a read surface needs it.
 * - **No raw email, ever.** `customer_id` is the provider's own opaque customer
 *   id (`cus_…`), which CP3 turns into a site-scoped `customer_hash`. An email
 *   address never enters this structure in any form — see `external_hint` below
 *   for why the hashed form is absent too.
 * - **Integer minor units only.** Every amount comes from the provider's own
 *   integer field. Nothing here is ever parsed from a decimal string or
 *   multiplied by 100; `packages/contracts/src/money.ts` has forbidden float
 *   money since M0 and 03 §6.5 restates it.
 *
 * Field names are snake_case because this is a stored JSON document read by SQL
 * and by CP3's writer, not a TypeScript interface that happens to be persisted.

/**
 * A matching signal that carries **no money**, lifted out of an event that
 * updates no object head (ADR-0033, D6 signal 2).
 *
 * The concrete case is `checkout.session.completed`: it carries the Checkout
 * Session id, the `client_reference_id` the site passed (the same stable user id
 * it gives `identify()`), the customer, and the PaymentIntent the session
 * created — and the charge that eventually settles carries **none of the first
 * three**. Stripe does not put them on the charge, so without somewhere to keep
 * them the strongest non-event matching signal in the design is simply lost.
 *
 * CP2 kept nothing from that event and said so in the adapter, for a reason that
 * has now changed: the hashing needs `ANONYMOUS_IDENTITY_SECRET`, which the
 * worker holds as of CP3 (D6 amendment). What has *not* changed is that the
 * **api** does not hold it, so a hint travels from the webhook to Postgres in
 * its raw provider form and is hashed by the worker at projection time.
 *
 * ## Why this is not an observation
 *
 * An observation goes through the object head's three-way decision, which
 * assumes one payload hash describes one complete state. A hints-only
 * observation would carry the checkout event's `created` — equal to the charge's
 * in the ordinary case, because the charge is created *by* the checkout — so it
 * would land on the equal-time-different-payload branch and spend a provider
 * request per checkout resolving a tie that is not about money. And if it
 * applied, it would bump `version` and rewrite the document that holds the
 * amounts. Neither is acceptable, so hints live in their own table with no money
 * column at all: a wrong hint changes an attribution, never a total.
 */
/**
 * ## Note for CP4's matcher: one hint can serve two charges
 *
 * A PaymentIntent may produce **several charges** — a declined attempt followed
 * by a successful retry is the ordinary case, and each is its own object with
 * its own head and its own fact row. All of them carry the same `order_id`, so
 * all of them join the *same* hint and all of them will carry the same
 * `external_user_hash` and `checkout_session_id`.
 *
 * That is correct at the fact grain: each charge really did belong to that
 * checkout. It is **not** correct to aggregate over — a matcher that counted one
 * attributed conversion per matched fact row would report two purchases for one
 * session, and a journey view would show the visitor buying twice. CP4 must
 * attribute at the `(session, order)` grain and pick a single charge per order
 * (the succeeded one; deterministically by `(occurred_at, object_id)` if more
 * than one qualifies), not per fact row.

 * Recorded here rather than in CP4's future file because this is where the

 * email". Neither of those is reachable from what CP2 stores, and pretending

 *
 * - **`metadata.oa_external_id`** lives on the Stripe *Customer*, which is a
 *   separate object. `RevenueNormalizedObject` carries no metadata, and the sync
 *   walk lists charges, refunds and disputes — never customers. Reading it needs
 *   a Customer fetch, which belongs with CP4's matcher (the worker holds both
 *   the credential keyring and the identity secret, so it can fetch and hash
 *   without anything at rest seeing the value).
 * - **The customer email** is worse: D-102 forbids storing it raw, and CP2
 *   deliberately refused to. So it can only ever be hashed *in flight*, from a
 *   payload that carries it inline, by a service holding the secret. The api
 *   holds no secret and the worker sees no payload, so in CP3 that path is

 * them without changing a caller.
