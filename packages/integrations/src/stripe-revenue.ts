/**
 * The Stripe revenue adapter (ADR-0033, D1/D4).
 *
 * SDK-free like the billing adapter beside it: `fetch`, a typed outcome, and no
 * third-party code on a path that carries a customer's own restricted key.
 *
 * The connection model is a **customer-created restricted key** — every
 * permission Read, nothing writable — plus a webhook endpoint the customer
 * points at their site's own OA URL. Not Stripe Connect: OA only reads, Connect
 * grants account-wide scope with no per-resource narrowing, and its
 * connected-account webhooks all arrive under one shared platform signing
 * secret, so a leaked secret would be every customer's problem rather than one
 * site's.
 *
 * ## What this module is and is not allowed to do
 *
 * - **It never throws.** Every failure — DNS, TLS, a reset socket, our own
 *   deadline, a 500, a 429 — is a typed outcome. A throw on the webhook path
 *   would be a 500 on a signed delivery Stripe retries forever; a throw on the
 *   sync path would be an unclassified job failure with no credential state
 *   behind it.
 * - **No response body leaves it.** `detail` is a status line or a reason word.
 *   These requests are made against a customer's own Stripe account with their
 *   own key, and the body of the answer is not ours to relay into a log line, an
 *   error envelope or an audit row.
 * - **Amounts are integer passthrough.** Every amount here is read from one of
 *   Stripe's own integer minor-unit fields with `asInteger`. Nothing is parsed
 *   from a decimal string, nothing is multiplied by 100, and a field that is not
 *   an integer is rejected rather than coerced — `packages/contracts/src/money.ts`
 *   has forbidden float money since M0, and a `Math.round` here would be the
 *   place a cent goes missing.

     *
     * The direction is implemented as Stripe defines it, and nothing depends on
     * it: the object head's three-way decision is order-independent by
     * construction, so a refund met before its parent charge produces a head
     * with a `parent_object_id` that resolves once the charge arrives, and the
     * matching layer reads both at query time. The only thing lost is that an
     * interrupted backfill holds the *newest* slice of the window rather than
     * the oldest — which is, if anything, the more useful half to have first.
     *
     * Recorded as a "Deviation (CP2)" line under ADR-0033 D4; the ADR stays
     * Accepted, because the decision it was making (checkpointed, resumable,
     * cursor-persisted paging) is unaffected.
