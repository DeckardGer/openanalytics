/**
 * Generates the self-host environment template from the schemas that actually
 * validate it.
 *
 * ## Why generated
 *
 * The template this replaces was handwritten, and a handwritten one drifts in
 * two directions at once. It had fallen behind — `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`,
 * `AUTH_PASSWORD_SIGNIN`, `GEOIP_DB_PATH`, `QUERY_SIGNING_KEY_ID`,
 * `QUERY_GATEWAY_AUDIENCE`, `ASSISTANT_MODEL`, `PORT`, `PRODUCT_NAME` and the
 * whole `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` block were absent, so an operator following it produced
 * a deployment that could not do several things the product does — and it had
 * drifted *ahead*, asserting that the migration runner creates the three
 * ClickHouse users, which nothing in this repository does.
 *
 * Neither failure is the author's: a document that has to be kept in sync by
 * memory will not be. So the inventory comes from `describeEnvSurface()`, which
 * reads the same zod schemas the services boot against, and this script refuses
 * to run if any variable is unaccounted for. What stays curated is the part a
 * schema cannot know — which section a variable belongs in and what a plausible
 * value looks like — and the completeness check is what keeps that curation
 * honest.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   pnpm run build          # reads the built domain package
 *   pnpm run env:example    # writes .env.example at the repository root
 *   pnpm run env:example:check   # fails if the committed file is stale (CI)
